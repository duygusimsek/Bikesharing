# Bikesharing - NYC CitiBike 

## Overview 

The purpose analysis is to prepare a series of visualization of the successful NYC Citibike bike-sharing program, CitiBike, and use these visualizations to attract investors for a bike-sharing program in Des Moines. 

For that purpose, August 2019 CitiBike data had been used and a series of graphs were created.  For this analysis, after formatting the trip duration data type to the DateTime, visualizations for the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders,  the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week, and the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week were created. 


## Result 
 
To format the data type of the trip duration from an integer to DateTime, using Python and Pandas functions, to get the time in hours, minutes, and seconds (00:00:00), the “tripduration” column was converted.
